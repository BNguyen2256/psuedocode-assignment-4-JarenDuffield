Go Fish is a card game that uses all 52 cards in the deck.
First one person shuffles the deck to make cards random.
Then that one person passes 1 card to everyone(clockwise) starting with the person to their left. 
Repeat until each person has recieved 5 cards included the dealer.
Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the players deck = draw deck.
When each player recieved those cards put equal valued cards together acsending in value from 2-Ace.
If you have all 4 of a card value put it down gaining a point.
    Example if you are dealt all 4 aces and 1 King put the 4 aces down gaining that point.
If you get the starting 5 with no pairs or matching 4 put them in order.
  The person to the left of the dealer starts by asking one person if they have a matching value of only one they ask for card in your       deck to match your card.
    Example if the one player asks you for a 3, give all 3's if not Go Fish.
The person receiving the question gives the person who is asking them the value of card the asked for.
If they don't have that value/card they say GO FISH.
  Then person asking the question would take a card from the deck.
If they aqcuire the card they originally asked for they get to ask again.
If you don't they put the card they aquired from the deck then put the card in their hand of cards and the turn goes to the person to the left of them.
Repeat until one the deck runs out of cards and no one has any cards left.
  You win if you end the game with more points than your opponent
  One point = 4 of same card value
  Count points to find winner.
